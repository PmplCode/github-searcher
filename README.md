# GitHub Searcher

GitHub Searcher is a single-page application (SPA) built with Next.js, enabling users to search for GitHub users and explore their repositories. Users can filter repositories by name and technology.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PmplCode/github-searcher.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd github-searcher
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```

4. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
